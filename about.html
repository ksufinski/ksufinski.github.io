        <p>
            On my way getting Bachelor degree I was participating in students
            program and spent half a year in US. After the trip I came back with strong zeal
            to new knowledge. Started experimenting with Java, then JavaScript (and continuing now).

        <p>
            Quickly finished few projects in 2016 and after I joined
            <span title="Ardas Group" style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer">company</span>
            as JavaScript Developer
            where I continue to work by now.
            I believe in long-term relationships, the key thing where is ability of
            each party to give and take something that they need.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2018 I felt like empowered to co-found
            <span title="inFocus" style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer">start-up</span>
            where I failed. Twice. So psyched I had this experience.
            I wouldn't know what to do without my close friend's support at that moment.
