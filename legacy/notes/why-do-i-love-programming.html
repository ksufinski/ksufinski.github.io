                I got acquainted with coding at the age of 12. And outright our relationships went sour.
                At this age a boring console application-calculator written in a strict programming language
                entirely killed any desire to do anything. In the course of time, my expertise was appended
                with new technologies but relationships with them didn't work out as well.

                When I was in the final year at academy my tutor offered me to make a choice between two extremely boring topics of a diploma project.
                At the thought of each of them, I got depressed. At that moment I clearly realized that I didn‚Äôt want to waste my time doing useless things.
                And it became the tipping point.

                Around the same time, I was in touch with guys from the polygraphic area (Hi, Sasha). We came up with an idea of a co-project which we started doing. Interestingly it was all about calculator(!). It was one big sophisticated calculator. Then I picked the most flexible and universal tool which was available. It‚Äôs been more than three years since then but I still consider that calculator to be my most interesting and complicated projectüôÇ. There was a need for that project, I managed to figure out the problem, find and bring into action a working solution which initially no one would believe in. And it was just the firstüòâ. That resulted in two diploma projects and unfortunately one unfinished commercial project.  But one needs to acknowledge that not all ideas can withstand user testing.

                I like to perceive programming as a tool, applied skill, popular craft of the 21 century. Today I think that solution (delivery, coding) isn‚Äôt the most difficult thing of this craft. It‚Äôs way more important to understand the kind of value you‚Äôre working on, put a question, find and understand the problem. And only after that if necessary you need to look for an elegant solution, a choice of tools, design, and delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having reread the previous paragraph I understood that I‚Äôd been writing not about programming but about an approach to life in general. But this pattern is applied to programming as well. :)
            </p>

            <p>
                It turns out the better you understand the value, explore the problem before you start to deal with a solution the more you understand the situation. The more you understand the situation the better you get a solution. And yes there are fewer problems to solve because an insight that not all problems are worth solving comes with experience. The fewer solutions you have the  fewer problems you‚Äôve got üëç
                And I like coding indeed. I like to understand that a solution will be beneficial to somebody, to design and to track the flexibility we‚Äôve got.   But I try to write a little.
